   abstract = {<p>Cultural heritage institutions have recently begun to consider the benefits of sharing their collections using linked open data to disseminate and enrich their metadata. As datasets become very large, challenges appear, such as ingestion, management, querying and enrichment. Furthermore, each institution has particular features related to important aspects such as vocabularies and interoperability, which make it difficult to generalise this process and provide one-for-all solutions. In order to improve the user experience as regards information retrieval systems, researchers have identified that further refinements are required for the recognition and extraction of implicit relationships expressed in natural language. We introduce a framework for the enrichment and disambiguation of locations in text using open knowledge bases such as Wikidata and GeoNames. The framework has been successfully used to publish a dataset based on information from the Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes, thus illustrating how semantic enrichment can help information retrieval. The methods applied in order to automate the enrichment process, which build upon open source software components, are described herein.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>At the domains of agriculture and livestock farming a large amount of data are produced through numerous heterogeneous sources including sensor data, weather/climate data, statistical and government data, drone/satellite imagery, video, and maps. This plethora of data can be used at precision agriculture and precision livestock farming in order to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, redesign business processes and support policy-making. The predictive power of the data can be further boosted if data from diverse sources are integrated and processed together, thus providing more unexplored insights. However, the exploitation and integration of data used in precision agriculture is not straightforward since they: i) cannot be easily discovered across the numerous heterogeneous sources and ii) use different structural and naming conventions hindering their interoperability. The aim of this paper is to: i) study the characteristics of data used in precision agriculture &amp; livestock farming and ii) study the user requirements related to data modeling and processing from nine real cases at the agriculture, livestock farming and aquaculture domains and iii) propose a semantic meta-model that is based on W3C standards (DCAT, PROV-O and QB vocabulary) in order to enable the definition of metadata that facilitate the discovery, exploration, integration and accessing of data in the domain.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The integration and harmonization of marine data from diverse sources are vital for advancing global oceanographic research and ensuring seamless discovery and access of critical datasets. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the metadata harmonization efforts within the Blue-cloud 2026 project, which brokers data from numerous Blue Data Infrastructures (BDIs), leveraging the Discovery and Access Broker technology. The platform enables discovery and analysis of marine data collections while facilitating interoperability with other components of the marine digital ecosystem, such as virtual laboratories and the Semantic Analyzer. It also supports the flow of Blue-cloud information to other initiatives like the Global Earth Observations System of Systems. For data managers, the findings emphasize the importance of enhancing metadata quality, revealing discrepancies in core metadata elements, and the need for more consistent use of controlled vocabularies. For cyberinfrastructure developers, the study details the challenges of accommodating a wide array of interfaces from different data systems, highlighting the adoption of an extensible brokering architecture that harmonizes metadata models and protocols. The study also emphasizes the importance of metadata analysis in ensuring effective searches for end users, highlighting challenges in aggregating diverse sources, where data providers may have structured the content with different objectives compared to those of the system of systems. End users will gain insights into the current metadata content of Blue-cloud, enabling them to search and access data from multiple BDIs with an understanding of the technical complexities behind the scenes.</p>},

In this context, metadata enrichment services through automated analysis and feature extraction along with crowdsourcing annotation services can offer a great opportunity for improving the metadata quality of digital cultural content in a scalable way, while at the same time engaging different user communities and raising awareness about cultural heritage assets. To address this need, we propose the CrowdHeritage open end-to-end enrichment and crowdsourcing ecosystem, which supports an end-to-end workflow for the improvement of cultural heritage metadata by employing crowdsourcing and by combining machine and human intelligence to serve the particular requirements of the cultural heritage domain. The proposed solution repurposes, extends, and combines in an innovative way general-purpose state-of-the-art AI tools, semantic technologies, and aggregation mechanisms with a novel crowdsourcing platform, so as to support seamless enrichment workflows for improving the quality of CH metadata in a scalable, cost-effective, and amusing way.</p>},

@article{Lafia2018,
   abstract = {We describe a method and system design for improved data discovery in an integrated network of open geospatial data that supports collaborative policy development between governments and local constituents. Metadata about civic data (such as thematic categories, user-generated tags, geo-references, or attribute schemata) primarily rely on technical vocabularies that reflect scientific or organizational hierarchies. By contrast, public consumers of data often search for information using colloquial terminology that does not align with official metadata vocabularies. For example, citizens searching for data about bicycle collisions in an area are unlikely to use the search terms with which organizations like Departments of Transportation describe relevant data. Users may also search with broad terms, such as "traffic safety", and will then not discover data tagged with narrower official terms, such as "vehicular crash". This mismatch raises the question of how to bridge the users' ways of talking and searching with the language of technical metadata. In similar situations, it has been beneficial to augment official metadata with semantic annotations that expand the discoverability and relevance recommendations of data, supporting more inclusive access. Adopting this strategy, we develop a method for automated semantic annotation, which aggregates similar thematic and geographic information. A novelty of our approach is the development and application of a crosscutting base vocabulary that supports the description of geospatial themes. The resulting annotation method is integrated into a novel open access collaboration platform (Esri's ArcGIS Hub) that supports public dissemination of civic data and is in use by thousands of government agencies. Our semantic annotation method improves data discovery for users across organizational repositories and has the potential to facilitate the coordination of community and organizational work, improving the transparency and efficacy of government policies.},

   abstract = {<p>Data integration is one of the most challenging tasks for digital collections whose data are stored across various repositories. Data integration across digital repositories has several challenges. First, data heterogeneity in terms of data schema and data values usually occurs across diverse data sources. Second, heterogeneity in data representation and semantic issues are among the problems. The same data may appear in different repositories with varied data representations, i.e., metadata schema. Recent research has focused on matching several related metadata schemas. In this paper, a metadata integration framework is proposed to support digital repositories in socio-cultural anthropology at the Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Anthropology Centre (SAC), Thailand. The proposed framework is defined based on the Metadata Lifecycle Model (MLM). It utilizes non-procedural schema mappings to express data relationships in diverse schemas. A case study of metadata integration over the SAC digital repositories was conducted to validate the framework. The SAC common metadata schema was designed to support data mapping across 13 digital repositories. The SAC “One Search” system was developed to exemplify the system implementation of the framework. Evaluation results showed that the proposed metadata integration framework can support domain experts in socio-cultural anthropology in unified searching across the repositories.</p>},

   abstract = {<p> Geoportals provide integrated access to geospatial resources, and enable both authorities and the general public to contribute and share data and services. An essential goal of geoportals is to facilitate the discovery of the available resources. Such a process relies heavily on the quality of metadata. While multiple metadata standards have been established, data contributers may adopt different standards when sharing their data via the same geoportal. This is especially the case for user‐generated content where various terms and topics can be introduced to describe similar datasets. While this heterogeneity provides a wealth of perspectives, it also complicates resource discovery. With the fast development of the Semantic Web technologies, there is a rise of Linked‐Data‐driven portals. Although these novel portals open up new ways to organize metadata and retrieve resources, they lack effective semantic search methods. This article addresses the two challenges discussed above, namely the topic heterogeneity brought by multiple metadata standards and the lack of established semantic search in Linked‐Data‐driven geoportals. To harmonize the metadata topics, we employ a natural language processing method, namely Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA), and train it using standardized metadata from <ext-link href="http://Data.gov">Data.gov</ext-link> . With respect to semantic search, we construct thematic and geographic matching features from the textual metadata descriptions, and train a regression model via a human participants experiment. We evaluate our methods by examining their performances in addressing the two issues. Finally, we implement a semantics‐enabled and Linked‐Data‐driven prototypical geoportal using a sample dataset from Esri's ArcGIS Online. </p>},

The integration of SKOS and ontologies can enhance search processes and metadata generation. This work demonstrates how to integrate SKOS within the ARCA system, used by RTVE for audiovisual management. The proposal focuses on adapting the relational schema structure of ARCA to unify the thesauri using the SKOS model. The process involves identifying concepts, labels, semantic relationships, and collections to create a single controlled vocabulary from the different thesauri, represented through a relational database schema. The results of the unified thesauri and the mapping of vocabulary concepts to Wikidata items are shown to reinforce integration in the realm of Linked Data.},

   abstract = {<p>With the increased use of geospatial datasets across heterogeneous user groups and domains, assessing fitness-for-use is emerging as an essential task. Users are presented with an increasing choice of data from various portals, repositories, and clearinghouses. Consequently, comparing the quality and evaluating fitness-for-use of different datasets presents major challenges for spatial data users. While standardization efforts have significantly improved metadata interoperability, the increasing choice of metadata standards and their focus on data production rather than potential data use and application, renders typical metadata documents insufficient for effectively communicating fitness-for-use. Thus, research has focused on the challenge of communicating fitness-for-use of geospatial data, proposing a more “user-centric” approach to geospatial metadata. We present the Geospatial User-Centric Metadata ontology (GUCM) for communicating fitness-for-use of spatial datasets to users in the spatial and other domains, to enable them to make informed data source selection decisions. GUCM enables metadata description for various components of a dataset in the context of different application domains. It captures producer-supplied and user-described metadata in structured format using concepts from domain-independent ontologies. This facilitates interoperability between spatial and nonspatial metadata on open data platforms and provides the means for searching/discovering spatial data based on user-specified quality and fitness-for-use criteria.</p>},

However, biomedical scientists face numerous serious difficulties finding, using and publishing useful databases. To address these issues, the authors developed a Resource Description Framework-based database platform, called the RIKEN MetaDatabase (http://metadb.riken.jp), that allows biologists to develop, publish and integrate multiple databases easily. The platform manages the metadata of both research and individual data described using standardised vocabularies and ontologies, and has a simple browser-based graphical user interface to view data including tabular and graphical forms. The platform was released in April 2015, and 113 databases, including mammalian, plant, bioresource and image databases, with 26 ontologies have been published using this platform as of January 2017. This paper describes the technical knowledge obtained through the development and operation of the RIKEN MetaDatabase to accelerate life science data distribution.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>For all research data collected, data descriptions and information about the corresponding variables are essential for data analysis and reuse. To enable cross-study comparisons and analyses, semantic interoperability of metadata is one of the most important requirements. In the area of clinical and epidemiological studies, data collection instruments such as case report forms (CRFs), data dictionaries and questionnaires are critical for metadata collection. Even though data collection instruments are often created in a digital form, they are mostly not machine readable; i.e., they are not semantically coded. As a result, the comparison between data collection instruments is complex. The German project NFDI4Health is dedicated to the development of national research data infrastructure for personal health data, and as such searches for ways to enhance semantic interoperability. Retrospective integration of semantic codes into study metadata is important, as ongoing or completed studies contain valuable information. However, this is labor intensive and should be eased by software. To understand the market and find out what techniques and technologies support retrospective semantic annotation/enrichment of metadata, we conducted a literature review. In NFDI4Health, we identified basic requirements for semantic metadata annotation software in the biomedical field and in the context of the FAIR principles. Ten relevant software systems were summarized and aligned with those requirements. We concluded that despite active research on semantic annotation systems, no system meets all requirements. Consequently, further research and software development in this area is needed, as interoperability of data dictionaries, questionnaires and data collection tools is key to reusing and combining results from independent research studies.</p>},

While these documents are useful in helping an end-user properly interpret the meaning of a column in a data set, existing data dictionaries typically are not machine-readable and do not follow a common specification standard. We introduce the Semantic Data Dictionary, a specification that formalizes the assignment of a semantic representation of data, enabling standardization and harmonization across diverse data sets. In this paper, we present our Semantic Data Dictionary work in the context of our work with biomedical data; however, the approach can and has been used in a wide range of domains. The rendition of data in this form helps promote improved discovery, interoperability, reuse, traceability, and reproducibility. We present the associated research and describe how the Semantic Data Dictionary can help address existing limitations in the related literature. We discuss our approach, present an example by annotating portions of the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set, present modeling challenges, and describe the use of this approach in sponsored research, including our work on a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded exposure and health data portal and in the RPI-IBM collaborative Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics project.

The resulting abundance creates opportunities for new analyses and insights, but that frequently requires integrating data from multiple sources. Inconsistent formats, access methods, units, and scales hinder data integration and make it a tedious or infeasible task. Standards such as the W3C RDF data cube vocabulary and the content-oriented guidelines of SDMX provide a foundation to tackle these challenges. In this paper, we introduce a framework that semi-automatically performs semantic data integration on statistical raw data sources at query time. We follow existing standards to transform non-semantic data structures to RDF format. Furthermore, we describe each data set with semantic metadata to deal with inconsistent use of terminologies. This metadata provides the foundation for cross-dataset querying through a mediator that rewrites queries appropriately for each source and returns consolidated results.},

   abstract = {<p>The digitization initiatives in the past decades have led to a tremendous increase in digitized objects in the cultural heritage domain. Although digitally available, these objects are often not easily accessible for interested users because of the distributed allocation of the content in different repositories and the variety in data structure and standards. When users search for cultural content, they first need to identify the specific repository and then need to know how to search within this platform (e.g., usage of specific vocabulary). The goal of the EEXCESS project is to design and implement an infrastructure that enables ubiquitous access to digital cultural heritage content. Cultural content should be made available in the channels that users habitually visit and be tailored to their current context without the need to manually search multiple portals or content repositories. To realize this goal, open-source software components and services have been developed that can either be used as an integrated infrastructure or as modular components suitable to be integrated in other products and services. The EEXCESS modules and components comprise (i) Web-based context detection, (ii) information retrieval-based, federated content aggregation, (iii) metadata definition and mapping, and (iv) a component responsible for privacy preservation. Various applications have been realized based on these components that bring cultural content to the user in content consumption and content creation scenarios. For example, content consumption is realized by a browser extension generating automatic search queries from the current page context and the focus paragraph and presenting related results aggregated from different data providers. A Google Docs add-on allows retrieval of relevant content aggregated from multiple data providers while collaboratively writing a document. These relevant resources then can be included in the current document either as citation, an image, or a link (with preview) without having to leave disrupt the current writing task for an explicit search in various content providers’ portals.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>Integrating diverse cues from metadata to make sense of retrieved data during relevance evaluation is a crucial yet challenging task for data searchers. However, this integrative task remains underexplored, impeding the development of effective strategies to address metadata's shortcomings in supporting this task. To address this issue, this study proposes the “Integrative Use of Metadata for Data Sense‐Making” (IUM‐DSM) model. This model provides an initial framework for understanding the integrative tasks performed by data searchers, focusing on their integration patterns and associated challenges. Experimental data were analyzed using an interpretable deep learning‐based prediction approach to validate this model. The findings offer preliminary support for the model, revealing that data searchers engage in integrative tasks to utilize metadata effectively for data sense‐making during relevance evaluation. They construct coherent mental representations of retrieved data by integrating systematic and heuristic cues from metadata through two distinct patterns: within‐category integration and across‐category integration. This study identifies key challenges: within‐category integration entails comparing, classifying, and connecting systematic or heuristic cues, while across‐category integration necessitates considerable effort to integrate cues from both categories. To support these integrative tasks, this study proposes strategies for mitigating these challenges by optimizing metadata layouts and developing intelligent data retrieval systems.</p>},

@article{Patrcio2025,
   abstract = {<p>Bibliographic ontologies are crucial to make the most of networked library metadata, but they show interoperability limitations in the Semantic Web. Following a research study on the subject, this paper presents a possible solution to such limitations by means of a reference ontology (RO) intended to allow integration of different ontologies without imposing a common central one and to overcome limitations of mapping techniques, such as crosswalks and application profiles, most used in interconnecting bibliographic ontologies. Interoperability issues of Resource Description and Access (RDA) and Bibliographic Framework Initiative—BIBFRAME (BF) ontologies are addressed using real-world examples from the Library of Congress (LoC) and Biblioteca Nacional de España (BNE) datasets. For a proof of concept of the RO, this paper is focused on two specific interoperability problems that are not solvable with the usual data transformative techniques: misalignments concerning the definition and representation of Work and Expression classes; and the absence of formalization of properties essential to whole-part relationships, namely transitivity, nonreflexivity and asymmetry. The potential of the RO for solving such problem examples is demonstrated by making in-depth use of Resource Description Framework Schema/Web Ontology Language (RDFS/OWL) semantic reasoning and inference mechanisms, combined with Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), when restrictions are needed to impose data constraints and validation. The RO innovation consists in the formulation of an independent high-level ontology, through which the elements of different source-ontologies are interlinked without being modified or replaced, but rather preserved, and in using semantic mechanisms to generate additional elements needed to consistently describe the relationship between them.</p>},

   abstract = {<p>The adoption of the European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulation has made integrating health data critical for both primary and secondary applications. Primary use cases include patient diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, while secondary applications support research, innovation, and regulatory decision-making. Additionally, leveraging large datasets improves training quality for artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly in cancer prevention, prediction, and treatment personalization. The European Union (EU) has recently funded multiple projects under Europe’s Beating Cancer Plan. However, these projects face challenges related to fragmentation and the lack of standardization in metadata, data storage, access, and processing. This paper examines interoperability standards used in six EU-funded cancer-related projects: IDERHA (Integration of Heterogeneous Data and Evidence Towards Regulatory and Health Technology Assessments Acceptance), EUCAIM (European Cancer Imaging Initiative), ASCAPE (Artificial Intelligence Supporting Cancer Patients Across Europe), iHelp, BigPicture, and the HealthData@EU pilot. These initiatives aim to enhance the analysis of heterogeneous health data while aligning with EHDS implementation, specifically for the EHDS for the secondary use of data (EHDS2). Between October 2023 and July 2024, we organized meetings and workshops among these projects to assess how they adopt health standards and apply Internet of Things (IoT) semantic interoperability. The discussions focused on interoperability standards for health data, knowledge graphs, the data quality framework, patient-generated health data, AI reasoning, federated approaches, security, and privacy. Based on our findings, we developed a template for designing the EHDS2 interoperability framework in alignment with the new European Interoperability Framework (EIF) and EHDS governance standards. This template maps EHDS2-recommended standards to the EIF model and principles, linking the proposed EHDS2 data quality framework to relevant International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards. Using this template, we analyzed and compared how the recommended EHDS2 standards were implemented across the studied projects. During workshops, project teams shared insights on overcoming interoperability challenges and their innovative approaches to bridging gaps in standardization. With support from HSbooster.eu, we facilitated collaboration among these projects to exchange knowledge on standards, legal implementation, project sustainability, and harmonization with EHDS2. The findings from this work, including the created template and lessons learned, will be compiled into an interactive toolkit for the EHDS2 interoperability framework. This toolkit will help existing and future projects align with EHDS2 technical and legal requirements, serving as a foundation for a common EHDS2 interoperability framework. Additionally, standardization efforts include participation in the development of ISO/IEC 21823-3:2021—Semantic Interoperability for IoT Systems. Since no ISO standard currently exists for digital pathology and AI-based image analysis for medical diagnostics, the BigPicture project is contributing to ISO/PWI 24051-2, which focuses on digital pathology and AI-based, whole-slide image analysis. Integrating these efforts with ongoing ISO initiatives can enhance global standardization and facilitate widespread adoption across health care systems.</p>},

This process identifies the correspondence relations called “Mappings” between the schemas to identify a global schema. This latter allows a uniform access to heterogeneous data. In this context, several works are proposed. However, the obtained mappings and the global schema are identified regardless of the user's profile. Thus, the queries results are the same for any user despite the various profiles. In this paper, we present a matching process that (i) deals with the metadata schema heterogeneities and (ii) considers the users’ profile.}
